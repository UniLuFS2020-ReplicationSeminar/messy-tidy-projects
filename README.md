# Messy and tidy projects
The folder provides two project examples:
- The folder `Messy Data Project` contains scripts and data files following bad practices. In particular, this project:
     - is not reproducible
     - uses absolute file and folder paths that cannot be shared
     - does not adopt a project-oriented workflow
     - lacks a rigorous folder structure
     - has no meaningful and informative names for scripts and variables. 
- The folder `Tidy Data Project` follows good-enough practices, instead. These include:
     - complete reproducibility
     - use of `here::here()` to make file and folder paths shareable
     - adopts the RStudio projects' workflow
     - uses a good-enough folders' structure
     - has meaningful and informative names for scripts.

The examples use the Digital Society Project data (http://digitalsocietyproject.org/) and are uniquely intended for teaching purposes.
